## Introduction

I upgraded my project‚Äôs PHP version from 7.4 to 8.1.

This article summarizes the steps I took and the considerations I encountered during the upgrade process.

## What This Article Covers

Upgrading PHP from version 7.4 to 8.1.

## Environment
- Using EC2
    - OS Image: Amazon Linux 2 Kernel 5.10
- PHP Version: PHP 7.4.33 (cli)
- PHPUnit Version: 9.5.28
- CakePHP Version: 4.2.12
- nginx: nginx/1.22.0
- php-fpm: PHP 7.4.33 (fpm-fcgi)

## Preparation

### Gathering Upgrade Information

#### PHP

Each PHP version is supported for three years (2 years active support + 1 year security support).
Since support for PHP 7.4 ended on November 28, 2022, I decided to upgrade to PHP 8.1 to ensure continued maintainability.

[PHP Supported Versions](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php)

First, I reviewed the official documentation for breaking changes:
- [Migrating from PHP 7.4.x to PHP 8.0.x](https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration80.php)
- [Migrating from PHP 8.0.x to PHP 8.1.x](https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration81.php)

#### PHPUnit

As I was using PHPUnit for testing code, I also checked compatibility between PHP and PHPUnit.

I checked the current PHPUnit version with the following command:

```
$ ./vendor/bin/phpunit --version

PHPUnit 9.5.28 by Sebastian Bergmann and contributors.
```

According to the PHPUnit and PHP version compatibility chart, PHPUnit 9.x supports PHP 7.3 and above.
Since I'm upgrading to PHP 8.1, our current version (9.5.28) remains compatible.

#### CakePHP

Next, I checked compatibility between CakePHP and PHP.

I confirmed the current CakePHP version:

```
$ cat ./vendor/cakephp/cakephp/VERSION.txt
...
4.2.12
```

Based on the CakePHP 4 System Requirements, CakePHP 4 supports PHP 7.4 and higher, including PHP 8.1. So there are no issues here either.

## Preparing a Test Environment

Since the service was already deployed, I needed to verify if the upgrade would succeed and ensure functionality post-upgrade in a separate environment.

I used another EC2 instance to test the upgrade to PHP 8.1, ran the test code, confirmed stable behavior, and then proceeded with the production upgrade.

## Steps to Upgrade to PHP 8.1

### Back up the php.ini file (PHP configuration file).

First, locate php.ini:

```
$ find / -name "php.ini" -ls

8651969   64 -rw-r--r--   1 root     root        62221  Jan 21 03:18 /etc/php.ini
```

Create a backup:

```
$ cp -a /etc/php.ini /etc/php.ini.org
```

If you have a custom version of php.ini, back that up as well.

Check the current PHP version:

```
$ php -v

PHP 7.4.33 (cli) (built: Nov 19 2022 00:22:13) ( NTS )
```

List installed PHP packages to reinstall them later:

```
$ yum list installed php*

Installed Packages:
php-cli.x86_64, php-common.x86_64, php-fpm.x86_64, php-intl.x86_64, php-json.x86_64,
php-mbstring.x86_64, php-mysqlnd.x86_64, php-pdo.x86_64, php-xml.x86_64
```

Remove current PHP packages:

```
$ yum remove "php*"
```

Check available PHP versions via Amazon Linux Extras:

```
$ amazon-linux-extras list available | grep php

42 *php7.4=latest            enabled      [ =stable ]
_  php8.0                   available    [ =stable ]
_  php8.1                   available    [ =stable ]
```

Disable PHP 7.4:

```
$ amazon-linux-extras disable php7.4
```

Install PHP 8.1:

```
$ amazon-linux-extras install php8.1
```

Verify installed PHP packages:

```
$ yum list installed php*

Installed Packages:
php-cli.x86_64, php-common.x86_64, php-fpm.x86_64, php-mysqlnd.x86_64, php-pdo.x86_64
```

Install any missing packages:

```
$ yum install php-intl php-json php-mbstring php-xml
```

Confirm PHP version:

```
$ php -v

PHP 8.1.14 (cli) (built: Jan 20 2023 18:11:30) (NTS)
```

Restart nginx and php-fpm:

```
$ systemctl restart nginx php-fpm
```

The upgrade is complete!

Now run the test code and verify behavior through the browser.

## Conclusion

Through this upgrade, I learned the importance of checking compatibility with related packages and frameworks like PHPUnit and CakePHP.

While I relied on reading documentation and running tests to identify incompatibilities, in the future, I‚Äôd like to try static analysis tools for migration checks (see: [PHP8 Migration Compatibility Check](https://www.bit-hive.com/articles/20230126)).

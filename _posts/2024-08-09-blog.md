When releasing a custom library, it can be tedious to manually build it locally, upload it to TestPyPI for verification, then upload it to PyPI, and finally tag and release it… 

So, I decided to automate the deployment using GitHub Actions.


## Objective of This Article

When you push a tag to the remote repository, this setup will automatically upload your package to PyPI and create a GitHub release.

After you push a tag from your local environment…

```
git tag vX.X.X
git push origin vX.X.X
```

The following steps will be automatically executed in order:
1. Upload to TestPyPI
2. Upload to PyPI
3. Create a release on GitHub and distribute the source code

We will create a workflow as shown in the image below.

## Steps


### Preparation

Note: Instead of using setup.py as the packaging tool configuration file, we will use pyproject.toml. According to PEP-518, pyproject.toml is recommended for modern Python projects.


Prepare your Python package and upload it as a project to both PyPI and TestPyPI.

If you already have a custom library on PyPI, you can skip this step.

Follow the tutorial below to upload a sample package to TestPyPI and PyPI:

https://packaging.python.org/ja/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/#creating-a-license


### Creating a Workflow File in GitHub Actions

In your repository, go to `Actions` > `Set up a workflow yourself` > Create a YAML file with any name (in this case, main.yaml) and commit it. 

It’s okay if the file is empty initially.


### Setting Up Publishing in PyPI

Traditionally, to upload a package from GitHub Actions to PyPI, you would need to create an API token in PyPI and store that token as a secret in GitHub.

However, by using Publishing, you can automatically issue and authenticate a temporary token when connecting to pre-configured services (including specific users, repositories, etc.)!

Publishing is easier to set up, and since the token has a short expiration time, it also offers better security.

From your project page on PyPI, select `Publishing` > `Add a new publisher`.

Fill in the fields as shown in the image below and click `Add`.

Next, open TestPyPI and create a publisher in the same way.

Use a different environment name than the one used for PyPI.

### Workflow in GitHub Actions

Now let’s write the workflow in the YAML file you just created.


#### 1. Start the Workflow When a Tag is Pushed

```yaml
name: Publish Python 🐍 distribution 📦 to PyPI and TestPyPI

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*.*.*'
```

#### 2. Build

To build the package, pyproject.toml must exist in the repository, so make sure it is not included in .gitignore.

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    name: Build distribution 📦
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4 # Checkout the code
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v5 # Set up the Python environment
      with:
        python-version: "3.x"
    - name: Install pypa/build # Install the build tool
      run: >-
        python3 -m
        pip install
        build
        --user
    - name: Build a binary wheel and a source tarball
      run: python3 -m build # Build the package
    - name: Store the distribution packages # Temporarily store the build artifacts in the dist directory under the name python-package-distributions
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: python-package-distributions
        path: dist/
```

#### 3. Publish to TestPyPI

```yaml
  publish-to-testpypi:
    name: Publish Python 🐍 distribution 📦 to TestPyPI
    needs:
    - build # Start the job only if the build job has completed
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    environment:
      name: testpypi # Enter the environment name set in the Publisher
      url: https://test.pypi.org/p/example-package-hanaosan0318 # Project URL

    permissions:
      id-token: write  # Grant Publishing permissions

    steps:
    - name: Download all the dists # Download the build artifacts that were saved earlier
      uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: python-package-distributions
        path: dist/
    - name: Publish distribution 📦 to TestPyPI # Publish to TestPyPI
      uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1
      with:
        repository-url: https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
```

#### 4. Publish to PyPI

```yaml
  publish-to-pypi:
    name: >-
      Publish Python 🐍 distribution 📦 to PyPI
    needs:
    - publish-to-testpypi # Start the job only if the TestPyPI publishing job has completed
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment:
      name: pypi # Enter the environment name set in the Publisher
      url: https://pypi.org/p/example-package-hanaosan0318 # Project URL
    permissions:
      id-token: write

    steps:
    - name: Download all the dists
      uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: python-package-distributions
        path: dist/
    - name: Publish distribution 📦 to PyPI
      uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1
```

#### 5. Create a GitHub Release

```yaml
  github-release:
    name: >-
      Create GitHub Release with source code
    needs:
    - publish-to-pypi # Start the job only if the PyPI publishing job has completed
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  
    permissions:
      contents: write # Grant permission to create a GitHub release
  
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4 # Checkout the code
  
    - name: Create GitHub Release
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # A temporary token that is automatically generated each time the workflow is run
      run: >-
        gh release create
        '${{ github.ref_name }}'
        --repo '${{ github.repository }}'
        --notes "Release for version ${{ github.ref_name }}"
```

Finally, you have defined the workflow!

You can view the entire YAML file at the following link:

### Deploying

Update the version in pyproject.toml to the release version and push the changes.

```project.toml
[project]
name = "example_package_hanaosan0318"
version = "2.0.3" # Change to the release version
authors = [
  { name="Example Author", email="author@example.com" },
]
```

Create a tag and push it.

```
git tag v2.0.3
git push origin v2.0.3
```

The package will be uploaded to PyPI and TestPyPI.

![PyPI](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mgted1dh9a1df0e0xmsp.png)

A release will also be created, and you can see the source code distributed in zip and tar.gz formats.

![release](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qzliwm29yyrfo9hycdm7.png)

And that’s it! 

You have now automated the process of uploading your package to PyPI and creating a release on GitHub when you push a tag to the remote repository.

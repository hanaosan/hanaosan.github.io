## About
I built a website using Jekyll with the Minimal Mistakes theme and hosted it on GitHub Pages.

To support multiple languages, I developed a custom language-switching feature.

As a result, I successfully reduced the annual operating cost from around $50 to just $2 (domain fee only).

## Creation Time
2 weeks(May 2024)

## Skills & Tools
Jekyll, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, GitHub

## About Me

I was born and raised in Saitama, Japan. From a young age, I was interested in foreign languages and cultures, which led me to study Mongolian and Tibetan Buddhism at the Tokyo University of Foreign Studies. I wondered, “If I can learn a spoken language, why not a programming language as well?” So, I started learning programming on my own. After graduating, I joined an IT company in Tokyo and began my career as a software engineer in 2022.
In 2024, I moved to the US and started working as a freelancer.

Outside of work, I love traveling and have visited 15 countries so far. I love exploring new places and cultures. I’m also an anime lover, and board gamer, and enjoy cooking with my family.

In my career, I’ve always appreciated all the team members I’ve worked with and clients who trusted me with their projects. They have helped me to grow as an engineer. Moving forward, I’ll continue to hone my skills and create software that makes the world more fun!

## Experience

### Freelance Software Engineer, Web Developer — USA, 2024-Current

I offer custom CMS site creation services using WordPress. Additionally, I am volunteering as a DevOps at Career Pathway Institute, a nonprofit organization in the United States.

### Software Engineer, RecoChoku Co., Ltd. — Tokyo, Japan, 2022-2024

I worked for 2.5 years, focusing on the development and maintenance of a music e-commerce platform, a recruitment site, and internal systems. I contributed to all stages of development, from design to operation.

I developed and improved over 50 REST API functions using CakePHP and reduced system bottlenecks by 70% through optimization. I also trained 8 new engineers, helping them complete a Twitter-like project within 3 months.

Additionally, I collaborated in Scrum teams of various sizes, gaining experience in team-based development and project delivery.
